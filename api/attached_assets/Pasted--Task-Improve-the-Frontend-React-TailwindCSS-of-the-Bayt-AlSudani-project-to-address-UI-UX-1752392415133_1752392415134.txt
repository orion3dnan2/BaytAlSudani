🎯 Task:
Improve the Frontend (React + TailwindCSS) of the "Bayt AlSudani" project to address UI/UX issues and missing user interactions.

📁 Project Stack:
- React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Pages already include: Home, Marketplace, Stores, Services, Jobs, Announcements, Profile, Dashboard
- Design should be mobile-first (PWA)

✅ Goals:

1. ➕ Add CTA (Call To Action) Buttons:
   - On each section (products, stores, services, jobs, announcements), add a clearly visible “Add New” button for merchants/admins only.
   - Example: `+ Add Product`, `+ Add Store`, etc.
   - Place button top-right of the list/grid

2. 👤 Profile Page Enhancements:
   - Redesign user profile to include:
     - Full name, email, role
     - User image/avatar
     - Joined date
     - Editable fields (name, password, etc.)
     - "Edit Profile" button
   - Add section to list user’s own stores, products, or services

3. 🏬 Store Details Page:
   - Include list of products/services related to the store
   - Add merchant contact info (phone, email if available)
   - Option to “Request Service” or “Contact Seller”

4. ⭐ Product/Service UI Cards:
   - Include:
     - Image
     - Title
     - Price
     - Short description
     - Merchant/store name
     - Button: View / Order
   - Make cards responsive and visually appealing

5. 📱 Navigation Improvements:
   - Add bottom tab navigation for mobile view:
     - Home | Marketplace | Services | Jobs | Profile
   - Make navigation sticky/fixed on mobile

6. 💬 Empty States:
   - If no products/stores/services exist, show a nice empty message with a CTA (e.g. “No services yet. Add your first one.”)

7. 🛠️ Optional:
   - Add “Filter” and “Search” inputs on top of each listing (products, stores, services)
   - Example: filter by category, price range

📌 Final Goal:
Deliver a modern, clean, mobile-optimized UI across all pages using TailwindCSS, with clearly separated user roles (customer vs merchant vs admin), and intuitive interactions for managing content.
